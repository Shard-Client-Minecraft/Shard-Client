# Shard Client



Simple and easy to use Minecraft client for 1.8.9 (and in futureâ„¢, newer versions).

## Licence
This project uses [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE), meaning that if you fork this project, it must be either completely private, or the code *must* be available to your users.

There are some parts of the code that use other licences (such as code "borrowed" from other projects). If this is the case, it will be noted in a comment, or another licence file in the same directory.

I would also appreciate it if people didn't sell this client when it releases.


Many clients lack important features, including ReplayMod.

There may be mod loaders like Forge and Fabric, which are perfectly good, but are not as easy to use and update.

## Features

Here are the main features that are currently in the client:

- A clean HUD inspired by Lunar.
- Replay Mod. You will need to install FFmpeg yourself. This is completely unaffiliated to the original mod by Johni and CrushedPixel. If you encounter any issues, try reproducing them on the official Forge version, and if it happens there, report it on the [ReplayMod GitHub repositority](https://github.com/ReplayMod/ReplayMod). If it only happens on our version, report it here.
- Freelook (automatically disabled on Hypixel), press "V" to activate.
- Toggle sprint.
- Smooth zoom.
- Motion blur (if that's your thing).
- 1.7 animations.
- Item physics.
- Hypixel Additions.
- OptiFine, downloaded automatically from the official site (open an issue if this is a bad thing).
- Crosshair mod, allowing you to customise your crosshair, while fitting with the vanilla style.
- Quick Play Mod. Allows you to quickly join games at the press of a button (by default, "M"). The key opens a menu where you can search for games, navigating through them using the arrow keys. If you type nothing, you can see recent games and a categorised list of all games.
- Customisable launcher servers - automatically detected from the game, with no pinned servers.
- Better item tooltips - show item damage and more.
- Symbol picker (happy, sad, and most importantly: the snowman).
- Chat channel display.
- Pop-up events (pop-up friend request, etc.).
- Customisable font and colour scheme.
- Turning off the inventory logo.
- Speedometer.
- Chunk animator (not sure if many people use this one).
- Bedwars timers.
- Resource pack folders.
